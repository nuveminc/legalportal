**SharePoint LegalPortal** (beta)
===========================

LegalPortal is a SharePoint-based application that utilizes SharePoint (SP) as 
the base platform for an intranet portal. The current release is in beta and 
requires some initial configuration which is described in the **Set-Up** section 
below.

This project is the result of a number of portal projects developed for various 
Legal Services organizations and provides basic features that were common through 
all projects.

The portal application adds a simpler and more intuitive User Experience (UX) to 
the out-of-the-box User Interface (UI) provided by SharePoint and was developed as 
a modular application framework to allow extensible "portlets" to be developed and 
added to the core set of features. 

SharePoint Version Support
---------------
This beta version supports both SharePoint 2013 On-Premises and SharePoint Online 
(Office 365). The **Set-Up** section below is the same for both hosted versions.
 

Application Architecture
---------------
The portal architecture consists of SharePoint as the platform to provide core 
services consisting of the following:

- Authentication
- Authorization
- Data storage (Lists, Libraries)
- Feature support (Blogs, Team Sites, Wikis)

The application architecture leverages several frameworks in addition to SharePoint. 
The additional frameworks make up the "Presentation" layer which is defined as the 
custom User Interface (UI) elements that augment the native SharePoint UI. 
Technology frameworks used are:

- jQuery
- moment.js
- AngularJS
- Twitter Bootstrap

Application Design
--------
Open source framework technologies are used with SharePoint in a novel way. 
Rather than implementing the custom interfaces as master pages and web parts 
deployed in custom solution packages, the framework is deployed as files to a 
SharePoint library. The code files (JavaScript)  are stored in standard SharePoint 
libraries (Site Assets) and the main entry page "LegalPortal.aspx" is stored in the Site Pages 
library as a basic Wiki page. By simplifying the deployment and file management, 
development is more rapid and deployments can be made to either SP 
on-premise or Office 365 (SharePoint Online).

---------

LegalPortal Features (Portlets)
------------
Portlets refer to the functional areas of the page - think of portlets as
the new "web parts". Portlets are, in reality, AngularJS Directives, so if
you want to extend the framework with new views of data, you can create a 
new directive or modify or extend an existing one and place it in the view.

- Weather: displays weather for your local area
- Blog: displays blog entries stored in your blog site
- Events: displays events
- Discussion Boards
- Twitter Feed 
- Document Library View
- Practice Areas Views
- Search (integration with native FAST)

----------

Set-up
--------
You can either clone the files from this repo or download the files as a zip file.
Once you have the files, you will need to perform some SP configuration.
The easiest way to play with this beta is to create a new Site Collection since you will need to create a Blog sub-site and a few lists and libraries to support the application. You can use an existing site, but be aware you will be creating new lists and libraries.

>**Note:** create the list or library specified with no spaces in the name. 
You can change the display name by changing the name **after** you have created the list.

>Also note that [root] refers to the "Site Collection" you are using

> The "portal" folder referenced below refers to the current versioned folder
that is in the repo (e.g. portal-v0.2.012116)  

 1. Copy the entire file folder (portal) into [root]/SiteAssets in SP ([root]/SiteAssets/portal-v0.2.012116) 
 2. Copy the file LegalPortal.aspx into [root]/Site Pages in SP ([root]/Site Pages/LegalPortal.aspx)
 3. Create a Blog sub-site named "Blog" ([root]/Blog)
 4. Create a new Calendar list named "Events" ([root]/Events)
 5. Create a new Discussion list named "JudgesDecisions" ([root]/JudgesDecisions)
 7. Create a new Discussion list named "WaterCooler" ([root]/WaterCooler)
 6. Create or ensure a library named "Documents" exists ([root]/Documents)
 7. Create a new library named "HowTo" ([root]/HowTo)
 8. Create a new Custom list named "Workgroups"

You will now need to make some changes to the code to customize your specific instance of this portal. The following files can be edited using SharePoint Designer (SPD) or you can edit the files outside SP and drag them into the correct folder using SPD.

**Portal Configuration Variables**

[root]/SiteAssets/portal/config/portal.config.js

Update "subsiteUrl" value if you are using a subsite (e.g. [root]/subsite/)
```
LegalPortal.constant('BASE_PATH', {
    // name of subsite (leave trailing '/' e.g. /LegalPortal/)
    subsiteUrl:             '/',
    // DO NOT CHANGE THESE VALUES
    modulesUrl:             rootUrl + '/modules/',
    dataUrl:                rootUrl + '/data/',
    pageUrl:                rootUrl + '/app/',
    portletUrl:             rootUrl + '/global/directives/portlets/',
    images:                 rootUrl + '/lib/images/',
    globalDirectivesUrl:    rootUrl + '/global/directives/',
    globalModalsUrl:        rootUrl + '/global/modals/'
});
```

Update the below values to change the Weather and Twitter Portlets 
```
LegalPortal.constant('PORTLET', {
    weatherCity: 'Seattle',
    twitterAt: 'ReutersTech',
    twitterId: '685274550158753792'
});
```

Update the below values to point to your Termstore

```
Portal.constant('TERMSTORE', {
    // GUID of the Site Collection termstore
    GUID: 'fb0add40-dde1-4939-b792-2f1a1db83c6e',
    // GUID of each of the mapped term sets
    TERMSETS: [
        { name: 'DocType', guid: 'bae365e8-2890-46da-b98e-7b4eb1446063'},
        { name: 'Groups', guid: 'e33657b5-3f90-4da4-8cf4-37e0826e67b5'},
        { name: 'Issues', guid: 'db3eefa8-b922-491d-9f7e-d97d4f119bac'},
        { name: 'TaxKeywords', guid: 'fb0add40-dde1-4939-b792-2f1a1db83c6e'}
